------------------------------------------------------------ the calcs tab

--- decides a few hundred.
---
--- Visibility and formatting are both PoB's. A row is shown when
--- CalcsTab:CheckFlag passes it against the active skill's flags, and its
--- value comes from formatCalcStr (Modules/CalcFormat.lua) resolving a
--- template like "{2:output:Speed}" against the actor.
---
--- UpdateSize is skipped deliberately. It is the layout pass -- positions,
--- heights, collapse state -- and the only thing here that depends on it is
--- the CheckFlag call it makes first, which this does directly. Collapse
--- state is skipped for the same reason: which sections are folded is this
--- UI's business, and hiding the rows here would stop it ever being able to
--- show them.
---
--- UpdateSize also calls a section's updateFunc, and exactly one section has
--- one: SkillSelect, which is hand-built in CalcsTab.lua rather than coming
--- from CalcSections.lua, carries controls instead of values, and uses its
--- updateFunc to refresh those controls' lists. So it is run, and that
--- section is surfaced as a selector rather than as rows of data.
---
--- Note that this selector is the Calcs tab's own (`input.skill_number`) and

--- apart: the sidebar always reports Effective DPS for the main skill, while
